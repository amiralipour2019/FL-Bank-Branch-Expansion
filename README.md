# FL-Bank-Branch-Expansion-Competition 2023-2024
Predictive Analysis for Branch Expansion: Identifying Optimal Location

# About the Project
As part of the Financial Addition Competition 2023-2024, our team embarked on a predictive analysis journey to identify optimal locations for bank branch expansion across Florida. This study employed a combination of historical transaction data and advanced machine learning techniques to drive strategic expansion decisions for Addition Financial.

# Project Overview
Through this competition, our collaborative efforts focused on uncovering the key predictors of branch performance. Our analysis was aimed at aiding strategic expansion and contributing to Addition Financial's growth within a competitive landscape.



# Dataset Description
The core dataset encompasses detailed records of member-level and branch-level transactions, including ATM usage, bill payments, and other key banking activities. We supplemented this with socioeconomic data from the U.S. Census Bureau, incorporating demographic and economic indicators to support our predictive model's context and accuracy.

# Data Exploration
A thorough exploratory analysis was conducted to understand the underlying patterns and relationships within the data. We visualized transaction frequencies, branch performance trends, and customer demographics to gain actionable insights. This phase was critical in shaping our feature engineering and modeling strategy, ensuring a robust foundation for the predictive models.

# Methodology
Our methodology is underpinned by rigorous feature engineering, creating a robust 'Branch Success' score from the transactional data. We split the data, directing 80% towards training and 20% towards testing. The models we deployed—Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression—were selected for their strengths in handling complex datasets and providing interpretability.

# Results
The analysis revealed that certain regions hold promising potential for branch establishment, with our Random Forest model achieving stellar accuracy and precision. Model evaluations, including accuracy and precision metrics, were visually depicted through confusion matrices to demonstrate their efficacy.

# Conclusions
Our recommendations for expansion are the product of a comprehensive analysis and data-driven insights. They are geared towards locations that exhibit the optimal mix of transactional activity and socioeconomic viability, promising a favorable pathway for strategic growth.
